# PopX

A playful React-based prototype for a mobile app with login, account creation, and settings, sprinkled with coder humor.

## Overview
PopX-App is a dummy web application designed to simulate a mobile app experience. Built as a learning project by AyushVishu15, it features basic user authentication flows (login and account creation), an account settings page, and a touch of humor with coder-inspired quotes. Itâ€™s a great starting point for experimenting with React and Tailwind CSS in a mobile-first design.

## Features
- **Login Page**: Sign in with a humorous quote to set the mood.
- **Create Account**: Register a new user with a simple form.
- **Home Page**: Welcome message with a funny coder description after login.
- **Account Settings**: View a placeholder profile design.
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation with "Home" and "Back" buttons.
